Launch multiple Task agents in parallel to complete the following task efficiently:

$ARGUMENTS

Instructions for parallel execution:
1. Break down the task into independent subtasks that can run concurrently
2. Launch multiple agents simultaneously using the Task tool
3. Each agent should focus on a specific part of the task
4. Coordinate results and ensure all subtasks are completed
5. Use appropriate tools (Grep, Glob, Read) for searching and analysis
6. Apply changes systematically using Edit/MultiEdit tools

Focus on maximizing parallelization while maintaining accuracy and avoiding conflicts.
